Download daily equity data from Alpha Vantage.

Placeholder for future implementation of TIME_SERIES_DAILY and TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED.
For now, use yfinance for daily data (data.yfinance.download_sp500_yfinance).

# TODO: Implement when needed
# - TIME_SERIES_DAILY: Basic daily OHLCV
# - TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED: Adjusted for splits/dividends
# 
# Note: Alpha Vantage daily data has same limitations as intraday (25 calls/day)
# yfinance is more suitable for bulk daily data downloads
